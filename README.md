# Typeform-csv-parser
Typeform online survey tools provides easy csv downloads. Getting a list of lists of strings from a csv is easy, this tool should help get a representation of the survey questions and answers.

## TODO:

- Provide a demo showing how to use the tools.
- Provide tests to demonstrate that the tools work.
- _Probably_ make it use dataframes.
